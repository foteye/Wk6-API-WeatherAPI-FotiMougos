### Brief:
Create a simple weather dashboard that allows the user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.

The program should allow users to:
* Search for a city and be presented with current and future conditions. This should include:
  * City Name
  * Date
  * Icon representation of weather conditions
  * Temerature
  * Humidity
  * Wind Speed
  * UV Index:
    * Color indicating favorable, moderate, severe
  * 5 Day Forecast with the above
* Previously searched locations should appear in a search history
* When opened, it should present with the last searched city
